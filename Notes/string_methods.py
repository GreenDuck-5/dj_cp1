#upper() makes it all uppercase

#title() capitalizes the first letter of every word

#What is a method?
#Allows you to alter a string in a specific way that doesn't reset the variable





#How do I write a method?
#The method you are using()





#What methods can I use to change the formatting of my string?
#Use an f string (f"sting is in here")




#What methods allow me to search the contents of my string?
#find() and .rfind()





#What methods allow me to change the contents of my string?

#replace(variable with the word in the sentence in it, "what is being replace with")




#Why is it important to know what type of output a method will give me?
#So you can build the code around that output
