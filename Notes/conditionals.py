#What are conditionals in python? 
#uses boolean to pick what will run


#How do we write an if statement? 
# if: if this is true below will run
    #what you want to run


#How do we write conditions?

#Why does the code need to be indented after the if?
# So the computer knows what to run if that condition is true


#Why do we want to have else statements?
#Backup


#How many else if statements can you create? 
#As many as you want


#Why does the order of your statements matter in a conditional?
#Because if one condition is filled it skips the rest


#How do we use boolean instead of boolean statements? 
#True
