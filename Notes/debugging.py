#What is the software development life cycle?
#A cycle to help plan out your project

#What are the steps in the software development life cycle?
#1:Project analysis - Figure out details
#2:Planning phase - Activity diagrams, write out pseudo code, assign tasks
#3:Execute plan - Write code, debugging
#4:Test code - More debugging
#5:Release and maintenance - Even more debugging, updates

#Why do we use the software development life cycle?
#To only have to do things once
#To actually solve problems
#Efficiency


#What are the 3 types of bugs that are most likely to occur in a program?
#Syntax error - grammar error
# => Read error message, go to that line off code, fix the syntax

#Logic errors - We gave the wrong steps



#Where do each of these bugs come from?


#How do we resolve each type of bug?


#What is debugging?
#The process of removing errors and unintended functions in code

#Why do I need to be comfortable with debugging?
